\ The Function TEST takes two integers

10	Function TEST Evaluates As ! (!!)
     \ The Parameter stack is accessed by the
    |\ stack-access operator '|' in conjunction
   ||\ with the indicator 'P' (for "Parameter").
  |||\ The number after the P indicates the
 ||||\ position on the stack (top-down).
1		Return |P(1) + |P(2)
2	End TEST.
   \ Note that the body of the function contains
  |\ its own line-numbering; this is to prevent
 ||\ the destruction of the parameter-stack's
|||\ precondition of matching the half-pattern.

\ Pushing a value to the stack is simple:
|\ Use the same "|P" (for accessing the parameter-stack)
||\ and append 'P' for "Push" followed by the value you wish to push.
