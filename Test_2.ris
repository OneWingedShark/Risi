\ ---EXCEPTION HANDLER EXAMPLE---
|\ Example gives an example of exception micro-handlers.
||\ Note that the exception-name may be optionally
|||\ prefixed [and separated by a colon] with a line
||||\ number; this forces the handler to only handle
|||||\ an exception of the indicated name thrown from 
||||||\ that line.

\ The default rate is 10.0, this is triggered by the
|\ boolean-coalescing operator inside the "fish-operator"
||\ (which is obviously the construct for manually throwing
|||\ an exception) the operator is <(*,*)><* where the stars
||||\ are, respectively: the exception to be thrown, the 
|||||\ controlling boolean expression, and the value to be
||||||\ passed when the controlling-value is not true.

\ Note that the Example's line 2 has the more general handler,
|\ this ensures that the specific case of line 6 is handled
||\ appropriately, while allowing the general case to still
|||\ be caught; note that this is a finer granularity of controlling
||||\ than most other languages provide.

1  ~"Exception-Handler Example"
2   Function Example evaluates as # (```)
1   \ 6:Type_Error ->  +10.0
2    \ Type_Error ->   +11.0
3     \ Zero_Divide -> +11.7

4    #Result = {}

   \ Note that we are using the Boolean-coalescing operator
  |\ to throw Type_Error when the fourth parameter is negative.
 ||\ Thus the Boolean-coalescing operator is equivalent to the
|||\ test for non-negative values.

5    Result/Append( "Initial Rate" =>	<( Type_Error, ??( |PP(3) ) )>< |PP(3) as ` )
6    Result/Append( "Growth"  => (|PP(1) / |PP(2)) as ` )
7   End Example.

10 @Prompts = ["Enter an initial rate:", "Enter a starting amount:", "Enter an ending amount:"]
11 if cursor: Prompts loop
12 ~cursor/value
13 |PP `~
14 end loop

15 Example
16 if cursor: Evaluated loop
17 ~cursor/key \\
18 ~" " \\
19 ~cursor/value
20 end loop
